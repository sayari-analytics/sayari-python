# Introduction

Welcome to the Sayari Graph SDK for Python. The goal of this project is to get you up and running as quickly as possible
so you can start benefiting from the power of Sayari Graph. In the new few sections you will learn how to setup and
use the Sayari Graph SDK. We also document some example use cases to show how easy it is to build the power of Sayari
Graph into your application.

# Setup
## Prerequisites
The only thing you need to start using this SDK are your Client_ID and Client_Secret provided to you by Sayari. (@Aleks to add info about getting these creds)

## Installation
To install the SDK, simply run `pip install sayari --extra-index-url https://us-east1-python.pkg.dev/sayari-datastore/sayari-python/simple/`
(The cmd above will change once this SDK is available publicly)

# Quickstart
This section will walk you through a basic example of connecting to Sayari Graph, resolving and entity, and getting that
entity's detailed information.

# Advanced
This is where we discuss things like token refresh, pagination, and rate limiting

# Tutorials

## Screening

## Investigations

## Trade Analysis

# Endpoints
Again, refer people to the API docs

Add a subsection of invocation examples for each SDK function
