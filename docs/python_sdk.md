# Introduction

Welcome to the Sayari Graph SDK for Python. The goal of this project is to get you up and running as quickly as possible
so you can start benefiting from the power of Sayari Graph. In the new few sections you will learn how to setup and
use the Sayari Graph SDK. We also document some example use cases to show how easy it is to build the power of Sayari
Graph into your application.

# Setup
## Prerequisites
Before using the SDK, you will need to install the required dependencies.

# Quickstart
This is where the hello world example will live

# Advanced
This is where we discuss things like token refresh, pagination, and rate limiting

# Tutorials

## Screening

## Investigations

## Trade Analysis

# Endpoints
Again, refer people to the API docs

Add a subsection of invocation examples for each SDK function
